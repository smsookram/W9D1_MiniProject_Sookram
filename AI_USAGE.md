AI Usage Statement

For this project, AI tools were used to assist with certain aspects of the development process. Specifically:

Setup and configuration: Guidance on creating a Python virtual environment, installing dependencies, and running the FastAPI server locally.

Error handling and debugging: Assistance interpreting Python exceptions, resolving missing package issues, and debugging API request problems.

Dockerfile creation and usage: Advice on building and running the Docker container for the model server.

README and documentation: Drafting and refining the project README to clearly describe setup, usage, and API endpoints.

All AI-generated content was reviewed, modified, and integrated by the project author to ensure accuracy, clarity, and alignment with project requirements.

No AI was used to write the model itself, train the model, or make design decisions regarding the model architecture or preprocessing logic.
